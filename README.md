**Everything you need to get your app live on the web and the stores!**

So, you've vibeâ€‘coded something cool for your phone with Bolt.new. What's next? How do I get this to the app stores? Let's talk about that.

> **How to use:** Do whatever works for you, but I like to copy this markdown into a new Issue in my appâ€™s GitHub repo. That way, I can check it off as I go!

---

## 1. Finishing touches to your code in Bolt

> You could technically do these after downloading your project, but might as well knock them out hereâ€”especially the parts Bolt can generate for you.

* CLICK INTEGRATION
* Add Github
* Add Supabase
  

* **App Icon & Splash Screen**

  1. Follow the guide: [https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon/](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon/)
  2. Use our Figma template for layout and export: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOiwZNy15OgLzkz4T-KrAfQd4\_0badRvh1sVXVdENYw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOiwZNy15OgLzkz4T-KrAfQd4_0badRvh1sVXVdENYw/edit?usp=sharing)
  3. Draw your own icon, use Figma tools or ask ChatGPT to generate a logo with a transparent background.
  4. In Bolt â†’ **Project Settings â†’ App Icon & Splash** â†’ upload each PNG.

* **Privacy Policy page** (`/privacy`)

  ```txt
  Bolt â†’ create a `/privacy` route. Summarize: "This app uses only local data, does not collect or transmit your location or personal info."  
  ```

* **(Optional) About page** (`/about`)

  ```txt
  Describe your appâ€™s features, link to `/privacy`, include a contact button if desired.
  ```

* **(Optional but recommended) Connect to GitHub**

  * In Bolt: **Project Settings â†’ GitHub** â†’ connect your repo for twoâ€‘way sync.

---

## 2. Sign up as a developer for the stores

> Youâ€™ll need accounts with Google and Apple to publish. These can take some time to activate, so sign up as soon as your app is at least featureâ€‘complete.

* **Apple Developer Program**: \$99â€¯USDâ€¯/â€¯year â†’ [https://developer.apple.com/](https://developer.apple.com/)
* **Google Play Console**: \$25â€¯USD oneâ€‘time â†’ [https://play.google.com/console/u/0/signup](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/signup)

---

## 3. Build, Deploy & Test

Download your project to your computer (via Boltâ€™s file export or GitHub) and run the commands below.
If any features wonâ€™t run in Expo Go (camera, inâ€‘app purchases, custom native code), add them locally and create a **Development Build** first:
[https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)

### iOS

```sh
# Build & submit to TestFlight
npx testflight
```

* Logs you into Apple, handles certificates/profiles, uploads a build.
* Check your email for the TestFlight invite code.
* Install TestFlight app, redeem code, and test.

### Android

```sh
# Build Playâ€‘ready AAB
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

* For quick local testing, use the `preview` profile to produce an APK you can sideload.
* Go to Play Console â†’ create or open your app â†’ **Internal testing** â†’ upload APK/AAB â†’ install via link.
* Note: New Google accounts may require a short preâ€‘release testing period.

### Web

```sh
# Export & deploy to web
npx expo export --platform web
npx eas-cli deploy --prod
```

* Publishes to your-project.expo.app by default.

**Optional:** Integrate [EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/introduction/) to push JS bugâ€‘fixes instantly without a full store release.

## 4. Prepare your store assets & copy

Youâ€™ll need images and text for your store listings. Create them now so you can paste them in order.

### Screenshots

**Recommendation:** Use [https://app-mockup.com/](https://app-mockup.com/) (free) to generate properly sized device mockups.

* **iOS**

  * 1 screenshot at **1320â€¯Ã—â€¯2868â€¯px** (iPhoneâ€¯16â€¯Proâ€¯Max)
  * (Optional) 1 screenshot at **2048â€¯Ã—â€¯2732â€¯px** (13â€³â€¯iPad)
* **Android**

  * 2 screenshots at a â‰¥â€¯9:16 ratio (any tall Android phone)

### Store Listing Copy

* **Store description**: Ask Bolt or ChatGPT to generate from your appâ€™s feature list.
* **Icon for Play Store**: Resize your 1024Ã—1024 PNG to 512Ã—512 (Preview or Paint).
* **Feature graphic (Play)**: 1024Ã—500â€¯px â†’ prompt ChatGPT to match your icon.
* **Short description (80 chars max)**: pithy oneâ€‘liner.
